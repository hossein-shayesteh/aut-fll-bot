# Managing Your User Profile

This guide explains how to view and update your profile information in the FLL Telegram Bot.

## Viewing Your Profile

To view your current profile information:

1. From the main menu, select "User Profile"
2. The bot will display your profile information, including:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Phone number
   - Student ID (if applicable)

## Updating Your Profile

You can update any part of your profile at any time:

1. View your profile as described above
2. Click on the field you want to update:
   - "Edit First Name"
   - "Edit Last Name"
   - "Edit Phone Number"
   - "Edit Student ID"
3. Enter the new information when prompted
4. The bot will validate your input and update your profile
5. You'll be returned to your profile view with the updated information

### Validation Rules

When updating your profile, the following validation rules apply:

- **Phone Number**: Must be in a valid format (e.g., 09123456789 or +989123456789)
- **Student ID**: Must be a valid Amirkabir University student ID, or "0" if you're not a student

If your input doesn't meet these requirements, the bot will ask you to enter the information again.

## Why Keep Your Profile Updated

Maintaining an up-to-date profile is important for several reasons:

1. **Faster Registration**: When registering for events, you can use your existing profile information instead of entering it each time
2. **Communication**: Administrators may need to contact you regarding your event registrations
3. **Student Discounts**: If you're a student, having a valid student ID in your profile ensures you receive applicable student discounts for events

## Privacy

Your profile information is only used for event registration purposes and is only accessible to bot administrators. It is not shared with third parties.

## Returning to the Main Menu

At any time, you can return to the main menu by clicking the "Back to Main Menu" button at the bottom of your profile view.
