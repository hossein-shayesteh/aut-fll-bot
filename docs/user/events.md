# Managing Your Events

This guide explains how to view and manage your event registrations using the FLL Telegram Bot.

## Viewing Your Registrations

To see all events you've registered for:

1. From the main menu, select "Event Status"
2. The bot will display a list of all your event registrations
3. If you have many registrations, use the pagination buttons to navigate through them

If you haven't registered for any events, the bot will inform you that you have no registrations.

## Registration Details

To view details about a specific registration:

1. From your list of registrations, click on the registration you want to view
2. The bot will display:
   - Event name
   - Registration status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
   - Registration date
   - Additional status information

The information displayed will vary depending on the status of the event and your registration:

- For approved registrations to upcoming events, you'll see a confirmation message and a cancel option
- For completed events, you'll see feedback options
- For cancelled events, you'll see a notification that the event has been cancelled

## Registration Statuses

Your registration can have one of the following statuses:

- **PENDING**: Your registration has been submitted and is awaiting admin approval
- **APPROVED**: Your registration has been approved, and you're confirmed for the event
- **REJECTED**: Your registration has been rejected (usually due to payment issues)

## Event Statuses

Events can have one of the following statuses:

- **ACTIVE**: The event is upcoming and accepting registrations
- **FULL**: The event has reached its capacity and is no longer accepting registrations

## Canceling Your Registration

If you need to cancel your registration for an event:

2. Click the "Cancel Registration" button (only available for approved registrations to upcoming events)
3. Confirm your cancellation
4. You'll receive a confirmation that your registration has been cancelled

Note: When you cancel a registration, the administrators are notified and will process any applicable refunds according to the event's refund policy.

## After the Event

Once an event is completed:

1. The event status will change to "COMPLETED"
2. You'll be able to provide feedback about the event
