# Providing Feedback for Events

This guide explains how to provide feedback for events you've attended using the FLL Telegram Bot.

## When to Provide Feedback

You can provide feedback for an event after it has been completed. The bot will automatically update event statuses, and you'll be able to provide feedback for any completed events you've attended.

## Accessing the Feedback Option

To provide feedback for a completed event:

1. From the main menu, select "Event Status"
2. Find and select the completed event you want to provide feedback for
3. Click the "Provide Feedback" button that appears for completed events

## Rating the Event

When providing feedback, you'll first be asked to rate the event:

1. The bot will ask you to rate your experience
2. Select a rating from 1 to 5 stars (where 5 is the best)
3. Your rating will be recorded

## Adding Comments

After providing a rating, you have the option to add a comment:

1. The bot will ask if you'd like to add a comment
2. Click "Add Comment" if you want to provide additional feedback
3. Type your comment and send it
4. Your comment will be recorded along with your rating

If you don't want to add a comment, you can skip this step by clicking "No Thanks".

## Viewing and Changing Your Feedback

If you've already provided feedback for an event:

1. When you access the feedback option for that event, the bot will show your existing rating and comment
2. You'll be asked if you want to change your feedback
3. If you select "Yes", you can provide a new rating and comment
4. If you select "No", your existing feedback will remain unchanged

## Why Provide Feedback

Your feedback is valuable for several reasons:

1. It helps organizers improve future events
2. It provides insights into what aspects of the event were successful
3. It helps other potential attendees make informed decisions about future events

## Feedback Privacy

Your feedback, including both ratings and comments, may be visible to event organizers and administrators. However, it is used only for event improvement purposes and is not shared with third parties.
