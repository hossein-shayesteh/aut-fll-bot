# User Management

This guide explains how to manage users through the FLL Telegram Bot's admin features.

## Viewing User Information

User information is primarily accessed through event registrations:

1. From the admin panel, click "List of Registrants"
2. Select an event
3. The bot will display a list of all registrants for that event

For each registrant, you can see:

- First and last name
- Registration status
- Phone number
- Student ID (if applicable)

## User Data Available to Admins

As an administrator, you have access to the following user data:

- **Telegram ID**: The user's unique Telegram identifier
- **First Name**: The user's first name
- **Last Name**: The user's last name
- **Phone Number**: The user's contact number
- **Student ID**: The user's university student ID (if provided)
- **Registration History**: Events the user has registered for

## Sending Messages to Users

You can communicate with users in several ways:

1. **Global Announcements**: Send a message to all bot users

   - From the admin panel, click "Announcements & Notifications"
   - Select "All Users"
   - Enter your message

2. **Event-Specific Notifications**: Send a message to participants of a specific event

   - From the admin panel, click "Announcements & Notifications"
   - Select "Event Participants"
   - Choose the event
   - Enter your message

3. **Individual Messages**: The bot doesn't provide a direct way to message individual users, but you can contact them using their phone number if necessary

## User Privacy Considerations

When managing user data, please keep in mind:

- User data should only be used for event management purposes
- Personal information should not be shared with unauthorized parties
- Users' contact information should only be used for event-related communication

## User Registration Status

Users can have different registration statuses for events:

- **Pending**: The user has submitted a registration request that needs approval
- **Approved**: The user's registration has been approved
- **Rejected**: The user's registration has been rejected
- **Cancelled**: The user has cancelled their registration

You can view and manage these statuses through the registration management features.
