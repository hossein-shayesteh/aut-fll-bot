## Exporting Data to Excel

## Automatic Event Status Updates

The system automatically updates event statuses:

- Events are marked as "COMPLETED" two hours after their scheduled end time

These automatic updates help maintain accurate event statistics.

## Using Reports for Future Planning

The data available through these reports can be valuable for planning future events:

1. **Attendance Trends**: Analyze which events are most popular
2. **Feedback Analysis**: Use ratings and comments to improve future events
3. **Registration Patterns**: Understand when most users register for events
4. **Capacity Planning**: Determine appropriate capacity for different types of events

By regularly reviewing these reports, you can make data-driven decisions to improve your event offerings.
